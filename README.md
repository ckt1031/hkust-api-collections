# HKUST APIs

[繁體中文](README_zh.md)

Scraped API for HKUST online services.

Those API are not officially provided by HKUST, obtained with reverse engineering, and may be changed without notice.

We do **NOT** provide the way to obtain the ACCESS TOKEN publicly, you need to find your own way to get it.

## Access Token

<!-- You can find me in school in person to get way of obtaining the access token. -->

However, after you get the way or you already know the way, never share it with untrusted people. I believe you know what you are doing, you would not want to get yourself into trouble right?

Also **NEVER** share the access token with untrusted people, they can do a lot of things with it. They can even cancel all your courses, class enrollment, libray and sports facilities booking, etc.
